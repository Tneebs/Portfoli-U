# Portfoli-U

Portfoli-U is a social project management app that allows users to connect through means of projects, all while keeping them organized.

The inspiration behind the app was entering a new job field and getting ready to connect with others in tech. Being able to show them projects I have worked on, while at the same time showing them how I kept organized throughout the process, was the goal in mind.
